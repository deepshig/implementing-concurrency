# Implementing Concurrency

It is a compilation of simple example codes to implement concurrent programming in Haskell. It uses the tools and functionalities of `Control.Concurrent` library in Haskell.

The project was developed as a research study over the following publications :

* [S.P. Jones, A. Gordon, and S. Finne. Concurrent haskell. 23rd ACMSymposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL’96), St Petersburg Beach, Florida, January 1996](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1996/01/concurrent-haskell.pdf)
* [S.P. Jones. Beautiful concurrency. In Beautiful Code. O’Reilly Media, May 2007](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/beautiful-concurrency/)
* [T. Harris, S. Marlow, S.P. Jones, and M. Herlihy. Composable memorytransactions.   Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Principles and practice of parallel programming (PPoPP’05), Chicago IL,USA, June 2005](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1065944.1065952)

## Dependencies

* [Haskell GHC v8.8.2](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_8_8_2.html)
* [Control.Concurrent](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Control-Concurrent.html)

## Run the program

* Any example code can be run by the command `runhaskell <file-name>.hs`
